### Discord-as-an-IDE

Inspired by MixMorris, the guy [who coded in PowerPoint](https://youtu.be/aBwuPmY4lec), but there are actually some limitations:
- Discord's character limit (< 2,000).
- Can't build Discord bot from Discord themselves because of having tokens (it will be reset automatically by Discord).
- Fully dependent on the machine it is being hosted (library, date format, etc.).
